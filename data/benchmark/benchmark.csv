Wnt signaling proteins including CTNNB1 and LEF1 were upregulated in CTNNB1 hotspot-mutated tumors despite DKK4, an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, being the most significantly upregulated protein. Because CTNNB1 hotspot mutations occur at key phosphorylation sites or neighboring amino acids, they may block phosphorylation-dependent β-catenin degradation. We also found significantly upregulated cell proliferation and transporter activity and downregulated total immune score in tumors with CTNNB1 hotspot mutations, consistent with existing knowledge. CTNNB1 hotspot mutations are concentrated near phosphorylation sites mediating pS45-induced degradation of β-catenin, which may render Wnt-FZD antagonists ineffective. ",SK,,personal knowledge

These results were somewhat expected based on the drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, the Reactome analysis showed an enrichment of the syndecan interactions and the extracellular matrix organization terms.

One of the most enriched terms under cisplatin action on the HCT-116 CRC cell line was TP53-regulated transcription of the cell death gene. The increased levels of TP53, BAX, FAS, and TNF receptor ligands indicate that cells were heading toward apoptosis. The increased transcript levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), which binds to cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 or 4 complexes and functions as a regulator of the G1 cell cycle, could support the notion of G1/S cell cycle arrest. Increased RGCC gene expression is also responsible for cell cycle regulation and is induced by p53 under DNA damage. Additionally, higher levels of BTG anti-proliferation factor 2 could have helped with G1/S cell cycle arrest. The increased levels of stratifin (SFN) transcript, whose product binds to translation initiation factors and functions as a regulator of translation during mitosis, help prevent DNA errors during mitosis and could indicate cancer cell survival. The increased transcription of the SESN1 gene, coding for sestrin 1, as induced by p53 and serving as a potent inhibitor of mTOR, would help in cisplatin’s cytotoxic effects. Although the increased levels of polo-like kinase 2 might also indicate a strong stimulus for cell proliferation, the weight of anti-proliferative signaling was stronger, which supports our MTT results. The increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and syndecan 1 (SDC1), responsible for cell binding, cytoskeletal organization, interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cell migration, could stimulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasiveness of the HCT-116 cell line. These are the signs of cancer cell progression.",SK,,BixBench

We analyzed differentially expressed genes and affected pathways in colorectal cancer cell lines to understand further the potential molecular mechanisms behind the treatments and their interactions.","Based on the results of the differential expression analysis of CBD vs DMSO, provide a discussion of the genes and affected pathways in colorectal cancer cells.",CRC Cells DE comparisons (cbd_vs_dmso): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w6OWn8WdvIU5btEomrLQl042S5o3hIzP/view?usp=sharing ,"CBD significantly affected carbohydrate metabolism, PPAR, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase, TGF-β, and MAPK signaling.
Furthermore, CBD decreased the expression of genes responsible for glucose metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis, such as PFKFB4, which regulates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and responds to hypoxia to help cancer cells produce more ATP. There was also downregulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression involved in the rapid activation of glycolysis in cancer cells. The transcript for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) was decreased, too. The function of GPI, along with the regulation of glucose metabolism, is acting as an autocrine motility factor, a tumor-secreting cytokine, and an inducer of angiogenesis. This shows that the addition of CBD inhibited transcription of factors that help cancer cells in energy and oxygen scarcity and might prevent cancer progression.
Addition of CBD changed the expression of NGF-stimulated transcription kinase and downregulated genes such as FOSB, EGR3, and EGR1. The FOSB gene codes for the FosB proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor, which can activate cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation in cancer cells. EGR3 and EGR1, transcripts for the early growth response 3 and 1, are regulators of cell mitogenesis and differentiation.
CBD showed modulation of TGF-β signaling pathways, including genes such as SMAD7 and SMAD3. SMAD7 was shown to antagonize signaling by the TGF-β type 1 receptor and inhibit TGF-β by associating with their receptors and preventing SMAD2 access. The upregulation of SMAD3, which is part of the transcription factor complex and can serve as a tumor suppressor, has a similar effect. There was also downregulation of gene expression of IL1RAPL1, which is a part of the IL-1 receptor family.
Interestingly, CBD decreased the expression of ABCA1, the ATP binding subfamily A member 1, which functions as a cholesterol efflux pump and is regulated by the PPAR signaling system. The ABC family transporters are commonly responsible for chemotherapy drug resistance. Thus, CBD might reduce the likelihood of drug resistance development. Furthermore, there was upregulation of CYP1A1, a gene coding for monooxygenase enzymes that take part in drug metabolism.
The decreased transcription of factor JUN could inhibit T-cell activation-induced death and reduce transcription in response to Toll-like receptor signaling. JUN transcript is also responsible for KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of USP28 in CRC. Furthermore, it takes part in the MyD88-dependent cascade initiated by endosome signaling. Additionally, CBD increased the expression of CD22, which helps in B-cell activation. Finally, there was a decreased level of MAP3K8 transcript, an oncogene coding for mitogen-activated protein kinase 8, which can activate both MAP and JNK pathways as well as pro-inflammatory pathways involving activation of NFκB.
Based on Reactome data for differential expression analysis in HCT-116 CRC cells, CBD had various effects on gene expression. It decreased the expression of genes responsible for glucose metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis, which may reduce tumor growth. It could also downregulate cell mitogenesis and differentiation genes. Additionally, CBD modulated pathways involving TGF-β signaling. This could decrease the likelihood of the development of drug resistance. In summary, these findings suggest that CBD may have potential therapeutic benefits for treating CRC. However, more experimental data would be needed to support this notion.",SK,,BixBench
3.3,"Transcriptome Analysis of Cisplatin, Cannabidiol, and Intermittent Serum Starvation Alone and in Various Combinations on Colorectal Cancer Cells","https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/19/14743

There was a strong upregulation of multiple genes that participate in NTRK1 signaling, including ARC, EGR1, EGR2, EGR3, EGR4, FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, ID2, ID3, ID4, JUNB, JUND, NAB2, SRF, and TRIB1. Most listed factors participate in cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The increased levels of EGR1–4, the early growth response genes involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and the increased level of serum response factor (SRF), which is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to extracellular signals, could indicate the activation of pro-survival mechanisms in tested cancer cells.
On the other hand, there was a downregulation of TF (coding for iron-binding factor) and VGF, a neuropeptide precursor implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. Downregulation of TF and VGF can have different effects on CRC, with TF downregulation potentially leading to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, while VGF downregulation may decrease migration and invasion of CRC cells.
There were multiple genes that were upregulated under the RAF-independent MAPK1/3 activation term, which involved DUSP1, DUSP10, DUSP2, DUSP4, DUSP5, DUSP6, and DUSP8. The upregulation of the listed DUSP genes in CRC can have different effects on MAPK signaling and may contribute to the development and progression of the disease. For instance, the upregulation of DUSP6 may inhibit ERK1/2 activity and prevent apoptosis. DUSP8 is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and deactivates JNK and p38 MAPKs, and it was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration of cancer cells. However, the upregulation of DUSP2 has been shown to have both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects in different cancer types. Overall, the effects of upregulating DUSP in CRC can be complex and may depend on the specific DUSP isoform.
Multiple genes responsible for interferon signaling, including EGR1, GBP2, GBP5, IFI35, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT5, MX1, OAS1, OAS3, OASL, SMAD7, STAT1, and UBE2L6, were also upregulated. Interferon signaling is thought to have anti-tumor effects by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and migration. On the other hand, some upregulated genes, such as STAT1 and SMAD7, could have pro-tumor effects. STAT1 is a transcription factor involved in immune system activation in response to viral infection, and it has been shown to promote tumor growth and survival. Additionally, SMAD7 is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway and can promote tumor growth and metastasis.
Another interesting effect of ISS was changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism via PPARα signaling. The expression of genes responsible for making medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADM) and supporting long-chain fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism (including the HMGCS1 gene, which is also involved in the synthesis of ketone bodies) was increased. There were a few genes that were downregulated, too. Decreased levels of ANGPTL4—coding for angiopoietin-like protein 4, which regulates lipid and glucose metabolism and the growth of new blood vessels—could lead to inhibition of angiogenesis in cancer cells. Interestingly, there was a decreased expression of NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1), which is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms by repressing the expression of core clock components. NR1D1 also regulates lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and the macrophage inflammatory response.
The genes BTC, EREG, HBEGF, and NRG2, which take part in the epidermal growth factor receptor family, were upregulated under ISS. On the other hand, the decreased expression of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which takes part in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival, could be one of the important targets in cancer therapy. Additionally, decreased levels of NRG1 transcript could decrease proliferation and survival. Moreover, lowering PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) and PTK6 (protein tyrosine kinase 6) could also inhibit cell growth, proliferation, and cancer progression.
The following genes were overexpressed in PI3K signaling under ISS treatment: AREG (amphiregulin), BTC (betaleucin), EREG (epiregulin), FGF9 (fibroblast growth factor 9), HBEGF (heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), NRG2 (neuregulin 2), PIK3AP1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor protein 1), and PIK3R3 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3). All the mentioned genes take part in the activation of cell growth, proliferation, insulin signaling, and cancer progression, which could result in unwanted effects of ISS in cancer. On the other hand, EGFR, NRG1, and PDGFA were downregulated under ISS. The epidermal growth factor receptor, coded by the EGFR gene, triggers a signaling pathway that promotes cell growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of EGFR by ISS could be beneficial in CRC therapy.
Under ISS treatment, many genes that code for the extracellular matrix organization were upregulated, including BMP4, CAPN8, COL3A1, COL5A2, FBLN5, ITGA1, SERPINE1, SPOCK3, THBS1, and TLL1. The bone morphogenic protein encoded by the BMP4 gene, which plays a role in cell differentiation and proliferation, was overexpressed under ISS. CAPN8, coding for calpain 8 protein, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, plays a role in cytoskeletal organization. The increased expression of genes encoding collagen type 3 and type 5 could indicate stimulation of connective tissue formation by cancer cells. Increased expression of the FBLN5 gene encoding fibulin 5 could help promote the adhesion of endothelial cells and help develop new arteries. Moreover, ITGA1 codes for an alpha-1 subunit of integrin receptors. SERPINE1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) is responsible for inhibiting fibrinolysis. Thus, an increased expression of the listed genes could help with the reorganization of extracellular tissue to the cancer cells’ advantage.
At the same time, multiple gene transcripts taking part in extracellular matrix organization were decreased. These included ADAMTS16, COL13A1, COL4A3, CTSK, DDR2, EFEMP2, FBLN2, FBN1, ITGA10, ITGA5, LAMA4, LAMB3, LAMC1, LAMC2, LOXL2, LTBP3, MMP16, P4HA1, P4HA2, PDGFA, PLOD1, and PRKCA. The ADAMTS16 gene encodes ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1. COL13A1 and COL4A3 encode collagen types 13 and 4, respectively. Collagen type 4 is a main structural component of basement membranes and helps with the formation of new vessels. CTSK encoding cathepsin K, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that could contribute to tumor invasiveness, was also decreased. DDR2 is a gene encoding the discoidin domain receptor subclass of the receptor tyrosine kinase protein family. This protein is a collagen-induced receptor that activates signal transduction pathways involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. EFEMP2, a gene encoding EGF-containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 2, is part of many ECM proteins involved in elastic fiber formation and connective tissue development; specifically, it participates in terminal differentiation and maturation of smooth muscle cells. FBLN2 codes for fibulin 2, an ECM protein that plays a role in organ development and can bind to fibrillin. The decreased levels of FBN1, encoding fibrillin 1, an ECM glycoprotein that is a structural component of calcium-binding microfibrils, could lead to the inhibition of cancer cell invasion. ITGA10 and ITGA5 code for integrin subunit alpha 10 and 5, which are collagen-binding proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion. LAMA4 (laminin-8 subunit alpha), LAMB3 (laminin B1k chain), LAMC1 (laminin subunit gamma 1), and LAMC2 (laminin subunit gamma 2) were decreased, too. Laminins, a family of ECM glycoproteins, are one of the main noncollagenous constituents of basement membranes, which are implicated in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and metastasis. Decreased LOXL2, encoding lysyl oxidase-like 2 delta E13 (essential to connective tissue biogenesis, which catalyzes the first step in forming crosslinks in collagen and elastin), could contribute to the inhibition of cancer invasiveness. LTBP3 (latent TGF-β binding protein 3), which encodes a protein that forms a complex with TGF-β and plays a structural role in the extracellular matrix, was also reduced. MMP16 (matrix metalloproteinase 16) takes part in the breakdown of ECM, tissue remodeling, and metastasis. P4HA1 and 2 (prolyl 4-hydroxylase, alpha polypeptide 1 and 2) encode a key component of prolyl hydroxylase, a major enzyme in collagen synthesis. PDGFA (platelet-derived growth factor subunit A) encodes the protein that is a part of PDGF, which is essential for cell proliferation, cell migration, survival, angiogenesis, and chemotaxis. PLOD1 (procollagen-lysine 1,2-oxoglutarate-dioxygenase) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) belongs to a family of serine–threonine protein kinases that can be activated by calcium. Its protein product takes part in cell adhesion, cell transformation, cell cycle checkpoint, cell volume control, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis.
Overall, the reduction of the vast majority of factors that take part in CRC’s invasion and metastatic mechanisms could represent a beneficial effect of ISS. ",SK,,BixBench

However, whether UBE2M is involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis remains unclear. In an Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced sepsis mouse model, increased UBE2M expression in macrophages in liver and lung tissues postinfection was observed. To further clarify the role of UBE2M in macrophages, mice with macrophage-specific deletion of UBE2M were constructed.
","We isolated and purified peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from control mice and mice with UBE2M deletion.  We then stimulated PMs with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and performed RNASeq.

Additionally, these DEGs were found to be associated with specific cellular regions, particularly those linked with the cell membrane. Enrichment within the molecular function category indicated a crucial role of UBE2M in cytokine interactions, with significant enrichment in “cytokine receptor binding”, “cytokine binding”, and “cytokine activity”. Moreover, the prevalence of DEGs associated with “antioxidant activity” and “glutathione transferase activity” combined with a general trend of upregulated gene expression underscores the potential importance of UBE2M in oxidative stress protection. 

Consistent with the GO analysis results, KEGG pathway enrichment revealed significant enrichment in cytokine-related pathways, such as ""viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor"", ""cytokine‒cytokine receptor interaction"", ""JAK‒STAT signaling pathway"", and ""TNF signaling pathway"". In addition, pathways related to pathogen infection and metabolism, such as ""Malaria"", ""Leishmaniasis"", ""Pertussis"", and ""Glutathione metabolism"", were also prominently enriched.

To date, the strategy to develop therapies for PCa mainly focuses on blocking either the activity or the transcriptional targets of known oncogenes. While the PCa transcriptome has been studied for decades, we have little knowledge of the translatome. The importance of this post-transcriptional regulation is underscored by the realization that RNA transcript levels are a poor proxy for protein abundance.

Translation initiation is a tightly regulated step critical to maintain the accurate protein dosage of growth and survival factors in cells.Importantly, emerging studies show that translation factors act in a rapid, selective, and robust manner to control the production of specific proteins. One of the most important of those factors is the RNA-binding protein and translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), which helps to unwind structured 5′ UTRs to increase translation initiation of select mRNAs in cancer.

Pharmacologic inhibition of eIF4A with zotatifin, a clinical compound, suppressed tumor growth in vivo, reducing both primary tumor growth and metastasis.

To understand how the inhibitor works mechanistically, we investigated the effect of zotatifin on the PCa translatome and proteome after a short treatment, as translation is one of the most rapid steps of gene expression.15 We performed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq)16 and MS after 6 h of zotatifin treatment in 22Rv1 cell xenografts in vivo (Figure 2A). While MS analysis assesses the effect of zotatifin on the global protein landscape in tumors, Ribo-seq can capture translation efficiency genome-wide at single-nucleotide resolution.16 Ribo-seq analysis revealed 554 downregulated transcripts at the translational level (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01 and log2FC ≤ −0.3, Figures 2B and S1L; Table S1). On the other hand, MS analysis showed that 339 proteins were downregulated upon zotatifin treatment (p value < 0.05 and log2FC ≤ −0.2, Figure 2C, Table S1). Next, we analyzed genes that are downregulated at the translational level as well as at the protein level by cross-referencing the two datasets using less stringent cutoffs (Ribo-seq FDR < 0.05 and log2FC < 0 and MS p value < 0.05 and log2(FC) < 0).

Notably, gene ontology analysis also revealed that several HIF1-dependent genes involved in different metabolic pathways, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate, and carbon metabolism, were also upregulated upon hypoxia but specifically repressed when cells were treated with zotatifin (Figure 6C). One of the hallmarks of hypoxia is to induce glycolysis that, in turn, promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis.33,34 Therefore, we hypothesized that reversing this effect by repressing HIF1α protein expression could be one of the pathways zotatifin acts on to reduce tumor burden.",WL,,

Here, we identified circRMST as an exceptionally abundant circRNA predominantly expressed in NEPC and SCLC, with strong conservation between humans and mice.

To explore the functional role of circRMST, we designed two shRNAs targeting the backspliced junction (BSJ), achieving 70%–93% knockdown efficiency (Figures 3A and S3A). In 3D Matrigel-embedded cultures, circRMST knockdown significantly impaired cell growth across three NEPC and four SCLC-A models (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B). Additionally, cell cycle analysis in SHP77 cells revealed cell-cycle arrest (Figure S3C). In vivo, SHP77 xenografts in NSG immunodeficient mice exhibited markedly reduced tumor growth upon circRMST depletion (Figure 3D).

For GSEA analysis, all genes were ranked by a combined score based on their FDR and fold change. The genes were ranked from the most upregulated to the most downregulated with unchanged genes in the middle of the list. The pre-ranked list was then loaded onto the desktop GSEA software (v4.1.0) for pathway enrichment analysis using the hallmark, KEGG and GO-biological pathway gene sets.

In steady state, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all circulating blood cells through a series of progressively restrictive differentiation steps regulated by coordinated and temporal expression of transcription factors (TFs), leading to balanced BM output.16 However, the molecular processes driving chronic, cancer-induced hematopoiesis, which leads to systemic inflammation, remain poorly understood.
We have previously demonstrated that expansion of metastasis-supporting neutrophils in mammary tumor-bearing K14cre;Cdh1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl (KEP) mice25 is driven by an inflammatory cascade in which tumor associated macrophage (TAM)-derived IL-1β leads to elevated serum levels of G-CSF,9,15 the principal instructor of neutrophil generation.To understand how and at what stage of differentiation tumors drive neutrophil expansion, we clustered the genes upregulated in tumor-bearing mice based on their dynamics along the neutrophil pseudotime trajectory. We identified three groups of differentially expressed genes in HSPCs from KEP mice, which we termed early, middle, and late, based on their expression patterns (Figures 2C and S4B). 
Early genes showed significant enrichment of an HSC-specific gene set (Figures 2D and S4C). Upregulated early genes were overexpressed in HSCs and MPPs from KEP mice compared to cells from control mice but were repressed in cells that were further along the inferred neutrophil differentiation trajectory. 
Middle genes were defined as genes that were expressed around the transition from MPP to GMP.
Lastly, upregulated/downregulated late genes, expressed in late GMP, GP, and ProNeu populations, were found to be expressed prematurely and at a higher level in progenitors from KEP mice (Figure 2C).",,"Data:

Upregulated middle genes showed enrichment for proliferation-related genes including MYC targets and mTORC1 signaling in HSPCs from KEP mice (Figures 2C and 2D).
Within the late upregulated genes, we found enrichment of MYC targets, mTORC1 signaling and neutrophil-specific genes associated with neutrophil granules, and neutrophil-mediated inflammation (Figure 2D).
