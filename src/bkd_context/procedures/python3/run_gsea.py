# reasoning or just repeating whta the llm read
# brand new papers, test whether is just repeating things that it has read
# load the file gene_expression.csv as a dataframe
       # The source dataset is a DataFrame
       # For this step you should load gene_expression.csv into dataframe and use this dataset and gene_sets equal to GO_Biological_Process_2023 to run the following code. print in idle.
